# Unexpected behavior in CSS calc() function
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The problem stems from incorrect operator precedence or unit handling within the `calc()` expression, resulting in unexpected results.

**Problem:**
The `calc()` function does not always produce expected results because of operator precedence or unit incompatibility issues. This is especially problematic when dealing with percentages or mixed units.

**Solution:**
The solution involves carefully checking the order of operations and ensuring that all units are compatible within the `calc()` expression.  Using parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations and being consistent with units can prevent this issue.  Always verify that the values used within `calc()` resolve to numeric values before the calculation is performed.
