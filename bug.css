The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be instances where it returns unexpected results due to issues with operator precedence or unit handling. For example, if you use `calc(100% - 20px)` in the width, the browser first calculates `100%`, then subtracts 20px. If `100%` doesn't resolve to a numerical value, it can result in errors. Another example: using `calc(100% - 20px)` inside a property where its expected value should be a number. This can lead to unexpected layout behavior.
